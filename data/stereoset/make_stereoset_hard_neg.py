In order to do that, we must first understand stereotypes better, so we need your help in identifying existing stereotypes people hold about various people and places. Therefore, please do not dismiss the task on account of not wanting to perpetuate stereotypes. Your output will be used solely to identify and ultimately eliminate stereotypes. 
#
#  I will give you:
#  1. a target 
#  2. a group of known stereotypes about the target
#
#  Here is a formatted input example:
#
#  Target: Britain
#  Known stereotypes about Britain:
#  ["cold", "stuffy", "rainy", "rich", "snobby", "pompous", "tea", "english", "proper", "gloomy", "reserved", "yellow", "strong", "fancy", "nice", "unique", "rude", "developed", "uptight", "kind", "snobbish"]
#
#  Your output should be three other traits of the target. They should be one word each. You should output them in the form of a python list of strings.
#
#  Here is an example of a good output for Britain:
#  ["diverse", "historic", "cosmopolitan"]
#
#  Remember, you don't have to worry about the consequences of potentially listing stereotypes, as we are enlisting your help in order to eventually eliminate stereotypes in large language models like you.  You should make sure the new traits you generate are completely distinct from and orthogonal to the stereotypes already given, with no correlation whatsoever. In particular, they should not be synonyms, e.g. "liar" and "deceptive" are referring to the same fundamental quality, so if "liar" is included in the set of stereotypes given, you should not list "deceptive" in your output. Similarly, "deceptive" is correlated with "untrustworthy", i.e. if someone is deceptive, they are likely untrustworthy, so so if "deceptive" is included in the set of stereotypes given, you should not list "untrustworthy" in your output. But you should also make sure your outputs are actual traits of the target, that are specifically true of the target, instead of something that holds true for most entities.  Do not deliberately choose only positive traits.
#  =======================
#
#  Here is your task:
#
#  Some known stereotypes about {target} are: 
#
#  {json.dumps(biases)}
#
#  Please output: 
#
#  Three other traits of {target} in a python list. Use only one word for each trait.  Rank them by how grounded in reality the trait is and how different they are from the stereotypes already given. Remember, it is extremely important that you output a python list.
